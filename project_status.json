  "notes": "Project predicts maximum sales prices for Magic: The Gathering cards using TimescaleDB data (market_prices, sales_history, listings) and card_attributes.csv. Completed fetch_card_data, fetch_market_data, merge_data, and pipeline modules. fetch_market_data.py simplified listings query (removed price_rank <= 5, added is_low_inventory flag for direct_inventory_count <= 5). merge_data.py implements granular merge (6.6M rows, 27.38% low-inventory) with asymmetric IQR (low: 1.5, high: 5.0), Eastern Time (ET) timestamp handling, and zero-filled sales_history missing days (sales_quantity = 0, sales_price_max = 0). Latest merge_data.py run (2025-05-10T11:46:03) succeeded, producing 6,624,411 rows with 1.24% NaN residuals.

**Outlier Analysis**: Asymmetric IQR (low: 1.5, high: 5.0) removed 2.78% (46,466 rows, $32.20â€“$500.00, mean $50.60), preserving high prices. Validation flagged 38 rows > 100x direct_low. No low-value outliers (e.g., $0.25) removed. Plan: Further validate in clean_data.py.

**Timestamp Handling**: Intraday ET timestamps resolved by aggregating sales_history by date, filling missing days with zeros, and localizing to ET. Residual NaNs (1.24% granular) to be investigated in clean_data.py.

**Direct Low Insight**: direct_low NaNs (1.36% granular post-imputation) indicate dropshipper out-of-stock, correlating with missing listings (115,920 rows). Plan: Flag as is_dropshipper_out_of_stock in clean_data.py.

**Merge Strategy**: Granular merge preserves seller variability and low-inventory signals (27.38%). merge_data.py stable, integrated into pipeline.py with modular switches.

**Pipeline Strategy**: pipeline.py implemented with switches (--fetch-data, --merge-data) for testing flexibility. Fixed pandas import and naming conflict issues.

**Clean Data Plan**: Sample granular merge (1M rows) for testing. Flag direct_low NaNs, impute listings missing days (direct_inventory_count = 0, is_missing_day flag), defer market_prices imputation. Validate outliers against direct_low, one-hot encode rarity and condition, keep set_name raw. Defer set release date via Scryfall to feature_engineering.

**Next Steps**: Develop clean_data.py with direct_low flagging, imputation, and encoding. Test pipeline.py with updated merge_data.py. Address ingestion issues (missing days, no out-of-stock records) in clean_data.py or pipeline."
